* Notes #1: Lead Character

	1. #### Character Archeatypes
		* Rick Casablanca
	    * Jack Sparrow/Han Solo 
	    * "Thief" - Indiana Jones
	    	- [Look at the Gentlemen Bastards, by Scott Lynch][tm]
	    	- [Riyria Revelations, by Michael J Sullivan][tm]
	    		- [if you just read the synopsis these are some characters I think mirror your intent.][tm] 

	2. ### Initial Plot (Lead Character = "LC")
		* Secretly son of Prince who was deposed
		* Lead Rebel's #2 man
		* Morally ambiguous

	3. ### Powers
		* Spidey Like sense?
		* Minor Telekinesis ... [I like this.. its like the Bene Gesserit in Dune .. a sect of people who can glean truth via intense perceptive capabilities. Also they can manipulate in similar sense by speaking in a very specific Bene-Gesserit-way... kind of like willing people in a minor sense.][tm]

	4. ### Tools of the Trade & Skill abilities [I sense a badass montage][tm]
		* Bow & Arrow
		* Picks
		* Prince of Persia Parkour


	5. ### Mentor
		* Obi-Wan [mostly a failure? lol... i guess he did okay with luke but ultimately handed him off to yoda, but i get your drift..][tm]
		* Female Merlin
		* Barristan Selmy
		*[Haven't read through to character flaws or weaknesses... granted he has to be a badass but no depth so far... everyone is too awesome][tm]
		* [The Warded Man - Peter V. Brett (Drunken Shit head mentor that used to be awesome but is all washed up)][tm]
			- [book isn't that great though.][tm]
		


		[Gonna send you this right now because Nick has chosen me as his next victim to not let me get anything done... Let me know if this is the type of feedback your looking for or if you want different/ more input? Dunno... Beyond realizing I read wayyyyyyyyy too much fantasy for my own good, I'm a little out of my depth.][tm]

		[I plan on saving all of this on my end, we can also start a repository (project) on GitHub and I can walk you through a process where we can both touch the same living documents and update them... just an idea, itd be a good forum to work out of.][]
